This project was given to us studying at Medieinstitutet as one of the examination tasks in our course in Framework.
This project was a collaborating task where we in the group had a close cooperation working together and sometimes even programming side by side, having an agility work process in mind.

My best contribution to this project was the admin page and its functionality as well as the editet images for the restaurant, we looked at at already existing restaurant in Stockholm and tried to copy it as closely as we could but still giving it our own touch, the original restaurant is called Dalanisse, instead of Dalanissa as in our project.

For working in this project I give my thanks to my studentcollagues https://github.com/LucasEdwa, https://github.com/diana888-png & https://github.com/Nidal99-git.
